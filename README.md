Code to run simulations and generate figures

**simulations_10042023_classes** contains the classes used to run simulations. **simulations_10042023_phase_space_simulations_alt_parameterizaation** takes arguments (passed through snakemake) to run simulations and output results.

Jupyter notebooks create figures from the data. Some of the plotting commands are dependent on specific versions of python; I used python 3.12.3.

Figure 1 - No data needed.

Figure 2 - Theoretical/cartoon results generated within notebook

Figure 3 - Data generated within notebook

Figure 4 - data for A comes from simulations analyzed using simulations_10042023_analyze_simple_simulations.py, data for B and C generated in notebook. 

Figure 5 - Data generated within notebook

Figure 6 - Simulation data analyzed via simulations_10042023_concatenate_values_copy.py.


Figure S1 & S2 - See separate readme

Figure S3 - Theoretical results generated within notebook

Figure S4 - Theoretical results generated within notebook

Figure S5 - Theoretical and simulated results generated within notebook

Figure S6, S7  - Analysis of simulations results comes from simulations_10042023_analyze_simple_simulations.py with simple output

Figure S8 - Analysis of simulations results comes from simulations_10042023_analyze_simple_simulations.py with full output

Figure S9 and S10 - ? "/burg-archive/palab/users/wm2377/snakemake_versions/Figure6and8/sdist_expon/simulations_summary_all.pickle"

Figure S11 - Output from simulations directly analyzed within notebook

Figure S12 - Simulations assume a single allele segregating at the time of shift and no more arise.

Figure S13-19 - same as Figure 6
